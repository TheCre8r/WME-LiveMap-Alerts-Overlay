I would like to thank davielde for the his hard work for this project, unfortunately with his absense there wasn't anyone who updated his script. He said in his original code, "Many thanks to Timbones and Twister-UK, whose code (WMECH and URO+) provided a large foundation for this work." I believe this is still true and their controbutions to this any many other projects has been invaluable. Finally, thank you for downloading this and feel free to contact me for any issues.

p.s. If davielde does return, all work of my may be surrendered.
